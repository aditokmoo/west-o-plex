                        <p>Have you started to notice that your home will heat or cool quicker in one room than in another? When you turn your air or heat on, the air travels through ducts that take it to each room. The dampers inside the ducts help navigate and control where the airflow is going. If there are issues with the dampers not being balanced correctly or any longer, it can cause one room to get hotter or colder much faster or slower.</p>

                            <p>Bad filters are something that so many people look past and never think about changing. You are supposed to change your filters every 3 months and even more often if you have several pets in the home. We suggest purchasing a large number of filters at a time, that way there is no inconvenience, you just set a reminder every 3 months and then just have to grab your filters easily.</p>
                        
                            <p> These filters are what stop dirt, hair, and other allergens from coming through your ducts and then flying into the air of your home. Your system has to have filters or it will not work the way it is supposed to and your energy bill will be through the roof.</p>
